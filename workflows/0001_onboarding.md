# Onboarding Workflow

This document outlines the onboarding process for new users and employers on the Seaside Talent platform.

## Steps
1. **Account Registration:**
	- The user or employer signs up by providing an email address and password.
	- A confirmation email is sent; users must verify their email before proceeding.

2. **Profile Verification:**
	- After email confirmation, the system checks the database to determine if a profile exists (employer or candidate).
	- If no profile is found, the user is prompted to create one and select their role.

3. **Dashboard Access:**
	- Once a profile is created or found, the user is directed to their respective dashboard based on their role (employer or candidate).

This workflow ensures a secure and role-specific onboarding experience for all users.
